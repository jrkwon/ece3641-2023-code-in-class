## How to install 

### Installing into a Conda environment
It's probably a good idea to create a virtual environment to keep this package and its dependencies separated from your other Python code and projects. If you've never used virtual environments before this might be a good time to start, and it is really easy using Conda:

```bash
conda create -n rvc3 python=3.10
conda activate rvc3
pip install rvc3python
```

## Activate `rvc` environment

```bash
conda activate rvc3
```
